title: "Choose Your Own Adventure"
---

I made this in 7th grade for my language arts final as one of my first coding projects ever- and boy was it ambitious. This choose-your-own adventure was built out of the terminal with text inputs, utilizing a .ini file for the narrative. Features include nearly 1000 lines of 7th grade level literature, inventory, health, and money systems, shops, inns, and encounters, cheat codes, and multiple paths for maximum replayability, all built on the hero's journey story structure.

The games starts with some expositions before dumping the player into a town at the bottom of Mount Everest. There the player can buy equipment that allows them to choose different paths on the journey ahead. First, there is a two-way split that then converges only to be seperated again into three directions. This is where the bulk of the game transpires, and where your choices of items at the start matter. Later, there is a different encounter for each path before converging once again to a village near the peak. There the player can fulfill quests and buy items before ascending to the top. At the apex of their journey there is one last encounter with the big bad, before a round of conlusions.
