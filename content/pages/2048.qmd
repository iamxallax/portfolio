2048; the oldie but the goodie! In this game you use the WASD keys (or matching buttons) to move numbered tiles to the other side of the board. Numbers of the same value can combine into one tile worth their amount combined, and the player continues until they have no more playable moves or they create the legendary 2048. This is where I branch off however, as I created options for a more customizable experience. I also hosted this game on Streamlit for anyone to try!
