title: "Birb vs Nuke"
---
This is a bullet hell made using Pygame in Python. I wrote in this in 8th for fun. You play as an affectionately named "Birb", trying to escape nukes and avoid bullets while collecting eggs before they crack on the bottom of the screen. There's some choice music including sounds for the egg cracking, and some fun meme sounds.
